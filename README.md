# project-1
 For this project, our group wanted to create an application that would be applicable to our every day lives. With Valentines Day coming up we thought a date generator would be a great idea. We decided on this idea because we all know that struggle every person goes through when trying to figure out the best date night for them and their significant other. With our date generator, date night just became a lot easier to plan, as well as making the failure to plan date night, a much more salvageable situation.
The purpose of this project was to use the skills and knowledge that we have obtained in this course so far, and create a fully functioning webpage to highlight those skills. We focused on utilizing our API's to the fullest extent, as well as being creative with the formatting and styling of our webpage. Our date generator is able to use the location that you provide to randomly create a dinner and event-style date for you and your significant other.
